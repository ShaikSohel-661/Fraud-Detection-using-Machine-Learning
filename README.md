# Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-Analyzing a Dataset with 6.3 Million Rows

Introduction:
Fraud has become an increasingly prevalent issue across various industries, costing businesses billions of dollars annually. To combat this problem, advanced technologies such as machine learning (ML) have emerged as powerful tools for detecting and preventing fraudulent activities. By employing ML algorithms and techniques, the project aims to identify fraudulent transactions accurately and efficiently.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset utilized for this project contains 6.3 million rows of transactional data, comprising various features such as transaction amount, transaction type, customer information, and other relevant details. The data is sourced from a financial institution, and each row represents a unique transaction. The dataset includes both genuine transactions and fraudulent ones, with the goal being to develop a model that can effectively distinguish between the two.

 After preprocessing the dataset, various ML algorithms are explored and evaluated for their effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions. These algorithms includes logistic regression, decision trees, and  k-nearest neighbors algorithm. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to assess the performance and generalization capabilities of each model.

Conclusion:
Fraud detection using machine learning is a critical application that leverages large datasets to identify and prevent fraudulent activities. This project focuses on analyzing a dataset with 6.3 million rows, utilizing various ML algorithms, preprocessing techniques, and feature engineering methods. By implementing these approaches, the aim is to build a highly accurate and reliable fraud detection model that can aid financial institutions in combating fraudulent transactions effectively. The evaluation of the models using appropriate metrics ensures their efficiency and effectiveness, leading to improved fraud detection capabilities and ultimately protecting businesses and consumers from financial loss.
